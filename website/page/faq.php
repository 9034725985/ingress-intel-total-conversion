<li>
<h4 id="no-penalty">Will Google/Niantic penalise me for using IITC?</h4>
There have been rumours that Niantic/Google have been asking people to stop using IITC, and penalising users
with a loss of points for doing so. This, as far as we can tell, is a hoax. Consider the following:
<ol>
<li>Before penalising users, they would request that this site is taken down. This has not happened.</li>
<li>Any such request would come via email, not via a Google+ message. Ingress is not closely tied into the Google
account system unlike, for example, Gmail; an email, like they already use for portal submissions, is the only
communication method available.</li>
<li>The message I've seen talks about "points" - when they should be talking about "AP".</li>
</ol>
Some notes from a Hangout available <a href="https://plus.google.com/111333123856542807695/posts/QtiFdoRuh6w">here</a>
with further details.

<li>
<h4 id="broken">No portals are displayed on the map!</h4>
Please update to the latest IITC to fix the map. If you use Chrome+Tampermonkey, or Firefox+Greasemonkey,
just triggering a manual update should do this. Alternatively, re-download and install from the
<a href="?page=desktop">download page</a>.
</li>

<li>
<h4 id="bluemap">What happened to the nice blue map?</h4>
Unfortunately this is no longer available, as IITC far exceeds the free quota offered by Cloudmade, the map tile provider.
You can use the layer selection menu to choose "Default Ingress Map", but this doesn't work as smoothly as we'd like.
Options to allow users to register their own free accounts for this are being considered - watch this space.
</li>

<li>
<h4 id="cheating">Isn't using IITC cheating/an unfair advantage?</h4>
IITC only uses data that is sent from the Ingress servers to the browser - it just displays it in an easy to use format.
There were, and continue to be, other browser add-ons that display this data - just not widely available.
Having a good quality, feature rich add-on, available to all - Enlightened and Resistance - ensures one side does not
have an unfair advantage.
</li>

<li>
<h4 id="export">Can you add an export feature?</h4>
No. As it stands IITC is tolerated, but not officially accepted, by Niantic/Google. Adding in features that
allow exporting of data outside the browser environment, or break additional Ingress terms of service
is likely to trigger a takedown request from Google.
</li>

<li>
<h4 id="otherapp">I used another <i>{ingress mod/IITC plugin}</i> and it's broken - can you fix it?</h4>
Probably not, no. If the plugin is not listed on this site, it's not part of my IITC distribution.
I do accept new plugins (see the Developer page for links to Github), but I do not accept any that
allow export of Ingress data outside of the browser or make use of data not retrieved by the standard intel website.
